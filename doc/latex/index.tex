\subsubsection{Futuba F\+P-\/\+S148 Servomotors}\label{index_subsubsection_name_3_2_6}
The servomotors are controlled by electrical impulses in a pulse width modulation signal (P\+WM) applied to them. To keep the servomotor operating, these impulses are repeated continuously by the A\+T\+Mega2560 microcontroller. The signal is periodic and is encoded in the pulse width (see figure 9).  To control the wheels of the robot, the pulse width applied to the servos determine the angular speed and direction of the wheels. \tabulinesep=1mm

\subsubsection{Futuba F\+P-\/\+S148 Servomotors}\label{index_subsubsection_name_3_2_6}
The optical encoders are used to determine the displacement and speed of the robot. Figure 10 shows how an infrared light illuminates the surface of the disk on a turning wheel. The phototransistor outputs logical 1 when the disk is illuminated and 0 when not. Because there are 64 regions (32 dark and 32 reflective) on the disk, there are 32 rising and 32 falling edges and time is measured between two rising edges.  \subsection{3.\+3 Product Functions}\label{index_subsection_name_3_3}
The objective of the this sprint, was to develop a robot that can\+: read from the thermal array sensor; perform a set of motions using the servomotors and photo-\/sensor circuit; calculate and print the speed and distance covered and reflect the direction of motion on he L\+ED.

This was accomplished by implementing a cyclic scheduler to schedule the different functions of the robot. The temperature is gotten from the thermal array sensor, by using the I2C Software Protocol to establish a communication between the microcontroller and the thermal array sensor. The microcontroller (acting as the master device), goes on to read the ambient temperature of the thermal sensor, as well as the surrounding 8 pixel temperatures. The ambient temperature and the average of the 4 left and 4 right pixels are then made available to the other modules.

The wheels of the robot and the head mount are both controlled by the servomotor. The wheels are controlled by setting the pulse width which determines the direction and the angular speed of the wheel; while in the case of the head mount, the pulse width determines its positions.

The speed and distance covered by the robot are both calculated using the number ticks between rising edges. The number of ticks is then converted to time by using the time elapsed between two clock ticks; the distance covered between two rising edges of the encoder is fixed. With the time elapsed and the distance, the speed of the robot is calculated.

The L\+CD display is used to display the instantaneous speed of the robot, the total distance covered by the robot, the ambient temperature of the thermal sensor, and the average of the four left and right pixels.

The Hydrogen Wi\+Fi shield L\+ED is used the indicate the direction of the robot. The color of the L\+ED is green when the robot is moving forwards, red while moving backwards, blue while spinning to the right or left and white when not moving.\subsection{3.\+3 Product Functions}\label{index_subsection_name_3_3}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The precision of the encoder on the stingray robot is limited. The encoder on the stingray is designed to have 64 transitions between the dark and light regions in every complete rotation. The time between the rising and falling edges of the encoder signal from wheel turning at a constant speed should not change; however because the L\+ED illumination is a beam and not a point, light is still reflected on the phototransistor until all of the beam is on the dark side. Therefore time is measured between two rising edges, instead of each transition from rising edge to falling edge, which reduces the precision since only 32 transitions are used in determining the wheel speed and distance travelled.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\section{4 Software Design}\label{index_section_name_4}
\subsection{4.\+1 Background Information}\label{index_subsection_name_4_1}


To enable movement of the servomotors, the Wheel\+Motion module makes use of the motion module to set the pulse width of the respective servomotors. To enable reading from and writing to the thermal array sensor, the I2\+C\+Multi\+Master software module was used. This module allows I2C communication via the hardware module provided in the Atmega2560 controller; thereby enabling us to configure the Atmega controller as the master device and the thermal array sensor as the slave device.

To print information to the L\+CD, the C\+E\+G4166\+\_\+\+R\+T\+S\+\_\+\+L\+IB U\+S\+A\+RT module was used, this module allowed us to open the usart port for output to the L\+CD; and thereby enabling us to print characters on the L\+CD screen. \subsection{4.\+2 Wheel\+Motion Software Module}\label{index_subsection_name_4_2}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The Wheel Motion module is responsible for controlling the two servomotors on each wheel of the robot, as well as the servomotor which the head mount of the robot is attached to. This is accomplished by using the motion modules \doxyref{motion\+\_\+servo\+\_\+set\+\_\+pulse\+\_\+width()}{p.}{motion_8c_a5afda449073815c408f11d7ce3c5ecbc} to set the pulse width of the motors; the pulse width of the wheel servomotors are then used to determine the direction and the angular speed of the wheels; while setting the pulse width of the head mount servomotor set the position which the head mount should be facing. The wheels of the servo motors are stopped using the \doxyref{motion\+\_\+servo\+\_\+stop()}{p.}{motion_8c_a299aca644308117ebfdb3d784943c035} function.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
This module is also responsible for calculating the speed and distance travelled by the robot. The distance travelled by the robot is gotten from the \doxyref{motion\+\_\+enc\+\_\+read()}{p.}{motion_8c_a783cb0180b4d2cd1979b20892e97a8e4} module, which determines if the wheel is currently moving, and then the distance between two rising edges of the encoder signal is added. The number of ticks between two rising edges of the encoder signal is also gotten from the \doxyref{motion\+\_\+enc\+\_\+read()}{p.}{motion_8c_a783cb0180b4d2cd1979b20892e97a8e4} function, which is then converted into time by multiplying it to the number of seconds between two ticks; so the speed of the robot is then calculated by dividing the distance by the time used to cover that distance. \subsection{4.\+3 Thermal Sensor Software Module}\label{index_subsection_name_4_3}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This module is responsible for reading information from the thermal array sensor. Communication between the atmega controller and the thermal sensor is done by using the functions provided by the I2\+C\+Multi\+Master module.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Firstly, the start sequence is sent with the master address, using the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Initialise function. Then the address of the thermal sensor (the slave device), along with the address of the internal address to read from, are then sent using the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Start\+\_\+\+Transceiver\+\_\+\+With\+\_\+\+Data function. Afterwards, the read command is sent to the slave device with the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Start\+\_\+\+Transceiver\+\_\+\+With\+\_\+\+Data funciton, and then the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Get\+\_\+\+Data\+\_\+\+From\+\_\+\+Transceiver function is used to gather the data gotten the thermal sensor. \subsection{4.\+4 Serial\+L\+C\+D\+Module Software Module}\label{index_subsection_name_4_4}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This module is used to print characters to the screen. Therefore, this module is responsible for printing the ambient temperature, as well as the 8 pixel temperatures read from thermal array sensor.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
This module is used to print characters to the screen. Therefore, this module is responsible for printing the ambient temperature, left temperature, right temperature, speed, distance travelled.

The screen is first cleared, then using the usart\+Write function, the cursor is positioned to the correct position to print to. Following this, the respective indicator tag and value is printed, moving the cursor each time to allow spacing between each piece of information to be displayed on the L\+CD. After printing, a delay of 10 milliseconds is used to allow the system enough time to switch tasks as well as finish printing. This value was determined to be effective after various amounts of experimentation with timings. \subsection{4.\+5 L\+E\+D Software Module}\label{index_subsection_name_4_5}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This module is used to change the color of the L\+ED, depending on the average temperature from the thermal sensor. Firstly, the pins assigned to the L\+ED colors are set to output at 5V. Afterwards, the L\+ED colors are set according to the direction the robot is travelling in using the avr/io modules 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\subsection{4.\+6 Software System Attributes}\label{index_subsection_name_4_6}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The system exhibits a high level of modularity by ensuring that like elements are grouped together logically and interdependencies between modules are kept at a minimum. We were able to achieve this by ensuring that all modules contained variables and methods that performed specific tasks such as grouping wheel motion functions in the Wheel\+Motion class and L\+ED and L\+CD related functions in the led\+Module and Serial\+L\+C\+D\+Module classes respectively. All of these modules would interact with a separate Scheduler module that handled the cyclic scheduling of the separate tasks to be performed by the robot.  Shown above is a diagram depicting the interdependencies between the modules present in the system; one can notice that there aren’t any two-\/way dependencies present, proving that the coupling between the modules is in fact low. This fact, along with the specific nature of each of the system’s modules in terms of function, demonstrate that our system is modular.
